# GenAI Accelerator Labs

Welcome to the official repository for the AI Engineering Accelerator program's hands-on labs! This repository contains all the practical exercises, code examples, and projects you'll be working on throughout the six-week accelerator.

## Overview

This repository is structured to follow the course curriculum, with dedicated folders for each week's exercises. As you progress through the accelerator, you'll build increasingly complex AI applications, culminating in a complete project that leverages the GenAI Launchpad framework.
